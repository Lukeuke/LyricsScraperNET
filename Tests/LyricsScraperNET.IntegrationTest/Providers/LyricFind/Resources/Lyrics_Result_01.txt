Now your heroes have fallen, championless
The seas are rising
So torch every banner, every hope of surviving
This storm is breaking
Security has left you treading water, now taste the fear
Taste the uncertainty, what will you do when there's nothing left for you to cling to?
What will you do with your one last breath?
Thrive in your emptiness, burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Our heroes have died
No heart, no hope, face to face with the abyss
One by one they fall away and won't be missed
Can you hear it? Can you hear the sound?
As our broken idols come crashing down
Now taste the fear
Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Our heroes have died
Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Burn all you love
