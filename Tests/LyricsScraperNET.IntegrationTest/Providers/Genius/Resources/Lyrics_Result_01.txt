[Verse 1]
Now, your heroes have fallen
Championless, the seas are rising
So torch every banner, every hope of surviving
This storm is breaking, security has left you
Treading water
Now taste the fear
Taste the uncertainty!
What will you do? (what will you do?)
When there's nothing left for you to cling to
What will you do? (what will you do?)
With your (one, last, breath!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thrive in your emptiness

[Chorus]
Burn all, you love
There's no hope for the weak
Your heroes, have died

[Bridge]
No heart, no hope
Face to face, with the Abyss (with the Abyss)
One by one they fall away and won't be missed
[Verse 2]
Can you hear it?
Can you hear the sound?
As our broken Idols
Come crashing down
Now taste the fear
Now taste, the, fear

[Chorus]
Burn all, you love
There's no hope for the weak
Your heroes, have died

[Outro]
Burn all you love
(There's no hope for the weak)
Burn all you love
