Now your heroes have fallen
Championless, the seas are rising
So torch every banner
Every hope of surviving
This storm is breaking
Security has left you treading water

Now taste the fear
Taste the uncertainty
What will you do (what will you do)
When there's nothing left for you to cling to?
What will you do (what will you do)
With your one last breath?

Thrive in your emptiness
Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Our heroes have died

No heart, no hope
Face to face with the abyss (with the abyss)
One by one they fall away and won't be missed

Can you hear it?
Can you hear the sound?
As our broken idols
Come crashing down
Now taste the fear
Now taste the fear

Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Our heroes have died
Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Burn all you love
